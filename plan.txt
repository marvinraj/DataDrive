DataDrive

what am i building?
- what a file management system using the MEVN stack

what's the plan?
1. setup backend -- get structure right
    - install dependencies/packages + nodemon
    - create a simple server
    - create .gitignore file & include node_modules in it
2. setup frontend --
    - npm install -g @vue/cli
    - vue create client
    - npm i axios
    - change cli version in package.json and run npm install
    - npm run serve
3. im completely new to vue, so i'll have to understand vue thorougly before
starting anything (complete a short tutorial)
